To re-play the traffic traces using multiple UEs use the script:
```
sh multi_tgen.sh config_file.txt
```
where config_file.txt is a text file that list the SRN for the experiment on seperate lines. The first line must be the gNB. See ex_config.txt for an example configuration file.
The KPI results will be saved in a new directory called "output_config_file". A text file called "output_config_file.txt" will be generated that lists what trace is used for what UE.

To enable IPsec
```
  start_ipsec.sh genesys-<gNB #node> genesys-<RIC #node>
```

To add interference use the script: 
```
sh interference_tgen.sh
````
